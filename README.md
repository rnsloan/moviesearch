Movie search using the [https://www.themoviedb.org](themoviedb) api and Material Design. 

### Note: Material Design Lite Usage

This project uses [http://www.getmdl.io](http://www.getmdl.io/) for the Material Design styles. 

I recommend looking at this issue before deciding to use in CommonJS project: [https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/issues/833](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/issues/833). 

At the time of writing, the main JavaScript file is constructed to be loaded using a `<script>` tag and the current workaround detailed in the github issue can cause pain when unit testing react components.
