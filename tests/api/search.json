It’s kind of hard to explain, really. You’ll have to check it out.\r The narration is completely in the center channel of the 5.1 mix, so I simply faded out any instance of it. I had to use the soundtrack to fill in a few musical holes, had to do a bit of foley work (new audio for the Ron Popeil infomercial on TV, whistling as Jack is leaving his job with the shopping cart), and had to trim a second or two off a couple of shots (very minimal and unintrusive).",
